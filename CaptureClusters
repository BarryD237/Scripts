This Script can Capture Gene Clusters given a tab seperated txt file:

Cluster_name "\t" First Gene_id in Cluster "\t" Last Gene_id in Cluster "\t"

This file was manually generated.. script to pull out Start/End doable, not so sure about Cluster_name

  This file does not capture the correct genes. 
  The unique filename writing does work, use this in future. 
  Print statements show locations are correct, no idea why record[start:stop] not cooperating.
